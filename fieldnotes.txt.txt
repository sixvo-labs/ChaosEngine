types:(null, refrence, noise, event)




hypothesis 1: The ground is shaking 
assumption: the neighboors huge foundation in causing my stilted home to shake
prediction: if detectable by this hardware, the accelerometer 

hypothesis 2: there is a negative pressure front caused by the door
assumption: this would also cause a physical reaction in the form of sound energy
prediction: a noticiable change in air pressure around time of events 

hypothesis 3: there is a woofer effect that occurs when door is opened and closed due to the volume of the house
assumption: this would cause my house to shake due to infrasound
prediction: test-logs should not be able to prove, disprove, indicate, nor counter indicate the premise, as the hardware is not currently equipped with analog sensors capable  infrasound detection
